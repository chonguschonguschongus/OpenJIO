# Motivation
Need one more to 3 vs 3 in basketball? Need a late night supper partner? Need one more to fill a mahjong table? You can find whoever you need using our application, OpenJio. Simply create an OpenJio on our platform and wait for like-minded individuals that are interested to accept! Not only can you fill up your numbers requirements, you can also meet new people who are open to exploring new things with you.
 

# Aim
The aim of our search is to bring together a diverse group of individuals who share a love for sports, mahjong, food, and socializing. Our goal is to build a community of like-minded people who enjoy playing sports, challenging their minds with mahjong, exploring new foods and restaurants, and hanging out with friends in a relaxed and casual atmosphere. We believe that by connecting with others who share our interests, we can create lasting friendships and memories, while also expanding our horizons and trying new things.


# User Stories
1. As someone who has an interest in a certain hobby that my current social circle does not, I can find like-minded individuals on OpenJio willing to enjoy this activity with me.
2. As a group of people who need a few more individuals to fill numbers for sports or other activities, we can find the people we need on OpenJio to come with us.
3. As someone wanting to try a new experience (new restaurant, explore new places), I can find interested people on OpenJio to come with me.
