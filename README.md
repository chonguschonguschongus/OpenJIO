Simply create an OpenJio on our platform and wait for like-minded individuals that are interested to accept!

# Aim
The aim of our search is to bring together a diverse group of individuals who share a love for sports, mahjong, food, and socializing. Our goal is to build a community of like-minded people who enjoy playing sports, challenging their minds with mahjong, exploring new foods and restaurants, and hanging out with friends in a relaxed and casual atmosphere. We believe that by connecting with others who share our interests, we can create lasting friendships and memories, while also expanding our horizons and trying new things.
